**Image Classification and Machine Learning Application**
- Developed a desktop application using **PyQt5** for an interactive user interface and user-friendly workflow.
- Implemented **image loading, processing, and classification** functionalities, allowing users to browse, view, and analyze images through the application.
- Designed a **training module** that enables users to train machine learning models directly within the application, utilizing **TensorFlow** for backend model training and classification tasks.
- Integrated key features such as an **image visualization component**, real-time feedback through a **status bar**, and structured output of results.
- Optimized application performance using libraries like **NumPy**, **OpenCV**, and **Scikit-learn** for efficient data handling and processing.
- Followed best practices in software development, ensuring modular code with separate function implementations for image classification, model training, and UI setup.
